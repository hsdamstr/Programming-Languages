This is a basic compiler I made for my programming langages class that compile pascals into assembly. each folder adds new features (PJProject 1 having the least features and PJProject4 having the most)

Steps to run:

> go into PJProject* directory and run make
> Run pjc on a .pas file in ./input
> Finally compile to outputted .s file to a binary
